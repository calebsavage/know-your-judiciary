# Know Your Judiciary
## A web project encouraging users to learn, discover, and ask questions about courts and judges.
### Technologies: 
- D3.js (mapping and data visualizations)
- HTML & CSS (Bootstrap framework)
- JavaScript

### Do you know how judges are selected in your area?
The strong devolved powers given to each state in the Union result in a diverse array of types of court systems and methods for selecting judiciary. Judges at the state and local level have a tremendous amount of individual power which is rarely given sufficient scrutiny. 

While elections offer certain advantages, the partisan nature of the electoral process in many states results in highly rancourous and well-funded contests.
